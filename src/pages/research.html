						<h4>Research</h4>
						<p>Martian Music Invasion’s highly-integrated research methodology and approach is the core foundation of our entire design process. Our work in creating Martian Music Invasion is focused on better understanding the effects of curiosity on gameplay and learning in children. We have chosen to focus our work primarily on the fourth intrinsically motivating factor in games: curiosity. Martian Music Invasion is designed to teach elementary school children how to read music notes on a musical staff. Our hypothesis is that by igniting curiosity for the intended learning content through a highly integrated game design, students’ learning gains will increase, intrinsic motivation will increase, and engagement levels in children will also increase.<br /><br />To explore this theory on integration and curiosity in game design, we evaluate two versions of our game with elementary school children. One version of the game includes curiosity features focused on integrated learning content, and the second version includes curiosity measures focused on non-integrated story or fantasy context. To date, we have conducted a research study with 150+ elementary school students. Currently, we are iterating on phase two of the research study to further explore this research area that may have influential implications for educational game design.<br /><br />For a holistic view of our research principles and processes, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjLyxPnlILsLvWoYhmbhcbJXPUtQit0-LLjVD99cdZs/edit?usp=sharing">Click here</a> to read our full report. </p>
