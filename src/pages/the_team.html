						<h4>Jennifer</h4>
						<p>At Martian Music Invasion, I lead the educational game research capabilities and research studies and play testing sessions behind the game. As we continue to iterate and design new features for the game, I also build the organizational partnerships with the educational communities. It is imperative that we partner closely with schools, after-school programs, music educators, and teachers to truly put the children and educational needs at the forefront.<br /><br />Martian Music Invasion was initially created as a year-long independent research study that soon grew beyond the confines of the year-long engagement. Observing Martian Music Invasion come alive in the classroom amongst the children and teachers ignited  my passion for the power of technology in the world of education - specifically, the power of technology designed and implemented well.<br /><br />The squeals of excitement and glowing faces of the children fueled this passion. The design decisions that were engaging for students and the ones that fell flat both ignited a desire to go back and iterate, playtest, and design for even better game experiences for the students. The wide spectrum of teachers - the highly passionate teachers whose zeal for learning overflowed into their students to the cold and unnecessarily harsh demeanors of some who stifled exploration and inspiration - highlighted the close partnership needed with schools and educational communities. The learning environment matters. Pedagogy matters. Teachers matter. Far beyond creation of an educational game, we knew we must create a rich and holistic learning environment, closely partnered with education communities, in which Martian Music Invasion was a piece of the whole picture. This became our new vision as the Martian Music Invasion team. And we are excited to carry this forward.<br /><br />My free time often includes making a mess around the apartment oil painting, all things creating films and watching films and reading film critics, reading books, and reveling in the satisfaction of finding cheap flight deals to places around the world.

						<h4>Rachel</h4>
						<p>I am the lead developer of Martian Music Invasion! I work mostly in Unity to develop and maintain features as well as chase down the never ending bugs. A big component of my work is to collaborate with everyone else to make sure the features are fun and educational by encouraging curiosity.<br /><br />I grew up playing a lot of educational games such as Jumpstart, Cyberquest games, and games on coolmath.com. I also grew up attempting to play violin, piano, and flute, and I’ve sung in a choir, so I’ve had my fair share of basic music theory through workbooks. I met Jen at Carnegie Mellon University, and was excited to develop a game that I wish I had when I was younger!<br /><br />Learning is a process we continue throughout our entire lives, and as such a crucial element, learning shouldn’t be boring. As a child, I became more interested in math as I played more educational math games, but I’ve also played my fair share of “chocolate-covered broccoli.” I’m eager for educational games to be both educational and fun, and I think Martian Music Invasion will help research and discover types of mechanics that support learning while engaging the players.<br /><br />In my free time, I’m usually playing video games or cooking. I love both retro and recent video games, particularly RPGs or games involving a puzzle or engaging narrative. I also enjoy learning about food prep from around the world, and attempting to replicate them in my kitchen!

						<h4>Eric</h4>
						<p>I’m the main artist and designer!  I have a hand in everything you see, from the character art to the user interface (with a few late nights here and there).  I believe that the look and feel of the game is just as important as the gameplay, especially in edutainment.  I’m curious to see how the visual design and user experience impact the learning aspects of a game.  Plus, I’m curious to see how many easter eggs I can put in the art!<br /><br />I became involved in the project through Jen actually; we were both in the same major at Carnegie Mellon University.  Through her I was introduced to the world of education games and how they helped children around the globe.  Since I worked primarily in design and animation, I decided to tackle the question of video game art and user experience, especially in the context of edutainment.<br /><br />Outside the game, I love drawing, animating, designing… you name it!  I have numerous side projects in motion graphics and digital art, so my plate is always full.  However, I also love to cook new recipes and play the latest games!

						<h4>Bo</h4>
						<p>At Martian Music Invasion, I work on developing the game’s introduction levels and managing the website. What’s so great about working on this team, though, is that everyone’s input matters in every area. We’ve all give and receive feedback to make a game that is truly every one of ours!<br /><br />In all honesty, I learned how to write primarily in World of Warcraft. Recognizing how much that game helped me learn outside of school, I came to Carnegie Mellon with educational games in mind. After joining CMU’s Educational Technology Club, I got in touch with Jen and joined the Martian Music Invasion team.<br /><br />I think that games have the magical power to motivate kids that otherwise find themselves uncomfortable in school or their traditional learning environment. If we can get kids excited about playing an educational game, whether it teaches music, math, or history, we can hopefully get those same kids involved and excited in the classroom.<br /><br />My passion is a sport called Martial Arts Tricking. It’s like cool gymnastics mixed with karate kicks. Check it out sometime, it’s really awesome!<br /><br />
