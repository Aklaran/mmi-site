						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>Martian Music Invasion is a digital educational music game designed to teach elementary school children how to read music notes on a musical staff.  Our aim is to integrate intrinsically motivating factors of gameplay with learning content in educational games to create a rich environment for inspiration and learning. As children navigate through this adventure with Supergirl doing battle with the evil Martians, Martian Music Invasion is designed to create high motivation and curiosity, high engagement levels, and increasing learning gains easily demonstrated beyond the game context. All of our work is grounded in education and game design research through continuous playtesting sessions and conducting research studies. We created Martian Music Invasion in order to pave a path forward in unlocking the potential of educational games as the future of education continues to be disrupted by growing technology capabilities.</p>

						<h4>Continuous, Agile Research</h4>
						<p>We believe educational games must strike a delicate balance of both fun and learning content. One of the major risks encountered in educational game development is limited knowledge transfer of learning content outside of the game context. Students are able to exhibit proficiency of the learning concept within the game, but are no longer able to without the specific game context. Continuous research to validate learning gains within and outside the game are a cornerstone of our educational philosophy. Our work is consistently grounded in education and game design research through continuous playtesting sessions and conducting research studies.</p><a href="research.html"> Learn more about our educational game research</a>

						<h4>Holistic Teaching Design</h4>
						<p>The Martian Music Invasion team believes that strides in educational games as a platform for teaching, whether inside or outside the classroom, require heavy partnership with teachers, schools, parents, after-school teachers, and administrators. An effective educational game without a well-designed and customized teaching environment renders itself ineffective. A child learns from an environment made up of people, technologies, pedagogy, techniques, and systems. As designers of Martian Music Invasion, we value the design of a holistic educational environment in which the game itself is one piece of the holistic picture. </p>
