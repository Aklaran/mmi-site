						<h4>About</h4>
						<p>Martian Music Invasion is a digital educational music game designed to teach elementary school children how to read music notes on a musical staff.  Our aim is to integrate intrinsically motivating factors of gameplay with learning content in educational games to create a rich environment for inspiration and learning. As children navigate through this adventure with Supergirl doing battle with the evil Martians, Martian Music Invasion is designed to create high motivation and curiosity, high engagement levels, and increasing learning gains easily demonstrated beyond the game context. All of our work is grounded in education and game design research through continuous playtesting sessions and conducting research studies. We created Martian Music Invasion in order to pave a path forward in unlocking the potential of educational games as the future of education continues to be disrupted by growing technology capabilities.</p>
